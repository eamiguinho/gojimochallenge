# Gojimo challenge

## Objective

Develop a very simple working application on your chosen platform (Android / iOS / Web) with the following functionality: 
1. Read the following JSON feed containing a list of qualiﬁcations (a sample is presented below for your reference): https://api.gojimo.net/api/v4/qualiﬁcations 
2. Display a list of qualiﬁcations based on the data provided by the feed. 
3. Allow users to click a qualiﬁcation to be presented with a list of subjects for that qualiﬁcation.

### BONUS POINTS
> Whilst not essential, we will be very pleased to see you take the challenge further by: 
1. Using the data provided to its full potential by taking advantage of ﬁelds like colour for subjects. 
2. Making the GUI as appealing and responsive as possible. 
3. Storing the data locally and refresh from the server as requested, taking advantage of the HTTP headers to avoid downloads of non-stale data. 
4. Unit testing your code.

## Developer resume
